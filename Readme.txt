This project is a comparison between Scale Invariant Feature Transform(SIFT) and Speeded up robust features(SURF), which are two common used features in Computer Vision and image processing field.
These two are essentially similar in concept.
The sift.cpp is SIFT implementation.
The surf.cpp is SURF implementation.
The test images should be in pgm format.
